Dog & Ghoul Maze Chase
A classic, retro-style maze chase game built to run in any web browser. Guide a brave little dog (üê∂) through a very simple maze,  collect all the treats, and grab the final bone (ü¶¥) to win,
BUT BUT BUT - all while being relentlessly pursued by a menacing ghoul (üëπ)!!

Gameplay
The objective is simple: survive and snack!

Objective: Navigate the maze and eat all the small white treats. Once all treats are collected, make your way to the bone to win the level.

Avoid the Ghoul: A ghoul will constantly chase you through the maze. If it catches you, the game is over!

Scoring: Your score increases with every treat you collect.

How to Play
The game is designed to be played on both desktop and mobile devices.

Desktop Controls:

Use the Arrow Keys (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí) to move.

Alternatively, use the WASD Keys (W, A, S, D).

Mobile Controls:

Use the on-screen directional buttons to control the dog.

Features
Responsive Design: The game canvas and controls adapt to any screen size, from a large monitor to a mobile phone.

Dynamic Audio: All sound effects (movement, eating treats, win/lose) are generated in real-time by the browser's Web Audio API. No sound files are needed!

Smooth Animations: Characters glide smoothly between tiles for a polished, fluid feel.

Smart Enemy AI: The ghoul actively hunts the player and navigates the maze to find the shortest path.

Single-File Architecture: The entire game‚Äîlogic, styles, and structure‚Äîis contained within a single HTML file for maximum portability.

Technologies Used
This project is built entirely with front-end web technologies, requiring no backend or special setup to run.

HTML5: For the basic structure and the <canvas> element.

CSS3 & Tailwind CSS: For styling the interface, title, modals, and making the layout responsive.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all game logic, including character movement, AI, collision detection, rendering on the canvas, and sound generation.

How to Run Locally
Since this is a self-contained project, running it is incredibly simple:



Open the index.html file directly in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

That's it! The game will start immediately. Enjoy!
